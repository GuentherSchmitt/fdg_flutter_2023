In 2023 Friedrich Dessauer Gymnasium in Aschaffenburg organized a Flutter training for their high school students. You can find a motivation for the training and the goals we wanted to reach in the following <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/fdg_flutter_2023/docs/01%20Why%20should%20I%20learn%20Flutter.pdf">presentation from October 2023</a>.

In the follwing we describe some of the Flutter apps we have worked on during the training:

## <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v02b_pageview">flying_balls</a>

Here we learned to use a Stack widget to position other widget, how UI elements can be shown or hidden after user interaction and a periodic timer brought some dynamic into the app. Finally we used gesture detection to modify the size of the box in which the balls are flying.

## <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v02b_pageview">canasta</a>

This app was the idea of one of the students. It helps to keep track the results of the card game "canasta". We used TextFields and DropDownButtons for user input and a PageView to switch between different pages.
