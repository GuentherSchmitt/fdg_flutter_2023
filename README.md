In 2023 <a href="https://fdg-ab.de/">Friedrich Dessauer Gymnasium</a> in Aschaffenburg organized a Flutter training for their high school students. You can find a motivation for the training and the goals we wanted to reach in the following <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/fdg_flutter_2023/docs/01%20Why%20should%20I%20learn%20Flutter.pdf">presentation</a>, shown at the beginning of the training in October 2023.

Below you can launch some of the Flutter apps, on which we have worked during the training:

### <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/fdg_flutter_2023/web_apps/flying_balls/">flying_balls</a>

Here we learned how to use a Stack widget for positioning other widgets, how to show or hide UI elements after user interaction and how a periodic timer can bring some dynamic into your app. Finally we used gesture detection to modify the size of the box in which the balls are flying.

### <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/fdg_flutter_2023/web_apps/canasta_calculator/">canasta_calculator</a>

This app was the idea of one of the students. It helps to keep track of the results when playing the card game "Canasta". We used TextFields, DropDownButtons and Checkboxes for user input and a PageView widget to switch between different pages.

### <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/fdg_flutter_2023/web_apps/lux_meter/">lux_meter</a>

Main goal of this app was to learn how to use external packages from <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a>, e.g. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/light/">light</a> to get values from the light sensor in Android or <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart">fl_chart</a> to visualize cartesian charts.
